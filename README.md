# Racquet Game Scorekeeper Website 

Site URL: https://jburrellirl.github.io/ProjectTwo/

This is a basic interactive website, to be used for keeping score for various racquet-based games. Here's a screenshot of the site to show that it's responsive to different screen sizes:

## UX

This website has a simple UI, that allows the user to focus specifically on the scoreboard area itself, without distractions. 


## Features



### Features Left to Implement

In the future, it'd be nice to expand this to include other games such as tennis, which have more complex scoring systems.

## Technologies Used

Below is a list of languages, plugins and other tools used to create and develop this website. 

* HTML5: To structure the website and the content included on the website. Semantic tags were used to make each section and code's used obvious.
* CSS3: To style the features used throughout the website to achieve design and placement targets e.g. adding padding, a background image, margins, fonts, and changing colors.
* JavaScript: To create the interactive elements of the website itself. 
* [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google fonts were used to import the 'Lato' font into the style.css file which is used for the text areas in this webpage.

## Testing

1. 

* The site was tested continuously across various modern browsers, especially in Google Chrome using the DevTools suite. I tested the site using the responsiveness tool, and the site is responsive across devices of varying screen widths. 

* The site receives a good score from the Lighthouse testing tool, as shown here:

### Bugs

* The main issue I encountered and resolved was one where the overall scoreboard area (at the bottom) would not reset the overall score variable after the game was finished, and after the Reset button was pressed.
* Resolved an issue where the JS file would not load and returned a console error. This was related to a wrong file path, and was resolved.
* No further unresolved bugs have been detected.

* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab, and under the GitHub Pages section, click on the "Check It Out Here" link.
